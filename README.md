# Equilibrium
Codes and results from partition function and equilibrium constant project for atoms and diatomic molecules.

See Barklem, P. S., and R. Collet. “Partition Functions and Equilibrium Constants for Diatomic Molecules and Atoms of Astrophysical Interest.” Astronomy and Astrophysics 588 (April 1, 2016): A96. https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526961.

A very minor bug was fixed in November 2022 that affects the atomic calculations, which slightly affects equilibrium constants.  See molcalc_atoms_extendedTbyPB/molcalc_atoms_extendedTbyPB for details of the bug and its effects.  Updated tables are given at public-data/partition-functions_and_equilibrium-constants.
