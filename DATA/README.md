# DATA

Data sets:

"CDS format data" contains the original published data in ascii formats put on CDS, plus versions of the same with the November 2022 bug fix.  This is the same as published on github at public-data/partition-functions_and_equilibrium-constants

Then I provide various data sets in idl binary format and/or ascii.  The main reason for this is provide calculations done on wider and more dense temperature grids.  But this should not imply the data are good at these temperatures - it is mostly to aid interpolation and extrapolation.
