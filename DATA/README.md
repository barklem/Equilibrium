# Equilibrium
Codes and results from partition function and equilibrium constant project for atoms and diatomic molecules.

See Barklem, P. S., and R. Collet. “Partition Functions and Equilibrium Constants for Diatomic Molecules and Atoms of Astrophysical Interest.” Astronomy and Astrophysics 588 (April 1, 2016): A96. https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526961.

The codes are provided as they are - they are unevenly documented, and due to the fact Remo and worked on the atomic and molecular parts in parallel, there are various versions of the code here.  If you wanted to try and do calculations start with AAnotes.

The most interesting thing are the results of various calculations, which are provided in the directory DATA.  They are provided as IDL binary files, and/or text files.

A very minor bug was fixed in November 2022 that affects the atomic calculations, which slightly affects equilibrium constants.  See molcalc_atoms_extendedTbyPB/molcalc_atoms_extendedTbyPB for details of the bug and its effects.  Updated tables are given at public-data/partition-functions_and_equilibrium-constants.
