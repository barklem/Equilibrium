# List of Molecules to calculate properties for
# Assumed that energy levels and partition functions are isotope independent
# and thus only mass need be defined differently for possible isotopes
#
### At present, usual isotopic mixtures are taken for atomic masses
### Test case only at present
#
# The list is kept general, in the sense that it allows molecules with more than 2 atoms
# but whether we'll ever be able to calculate for these is another issue entirely
# Huber and Herzberg lists only deal with diatomic, and usual molecular parameters 
# have no meaning
# A possiblility is to use the NIST thermodynamical data
